Personal studies on Android Studio with Java, Gradle and more!

I'm starting this repository with code I'm creating by following (and adapting) Alura's course on Android Studio and app creation with Java.

Concepts I'm studying:

- Activities ☑️
- Views☑️
- Android Emulation☑️
- Android Studio IDE☑️
- OOP in Android with Java☑️

## USAGE

For now, the application is just a simple list of students, written with #Java and #Gradle in #AndroidStudio . You may add new students to the list by clicking the + button and filling the required information!

To take it a step further, I am now experimenting with saving the student objects as JSON in SharedPreferences so the list isn't lost when the app closes. It's a great way to practice data persistence logic before I dive into industry-standard databases like Room!

## UPDATE 05-01-2026

Welcome to 2026! A new update now allows users to click on the name of a Student they previously added to the list to check the information for that student (see screenshow below). You may then go back to the previous screen to add more Students or check the information for another one! :)
